I have created a tictactoe file in which I have added 2 variables (i.e ticTacToe, currentPlayer). tictactoe array used to manage the 9 fields, to show the icon and update the row array value based on the field clicked by the players. And currentPlayer will get updated every time when the player picks the field.

setInitialvalues function used to reset the state variables.

renderIcon function check the field value in the ticTacToe array and return the icon based on the field value.

getWinner function check the winner in the row and column then return it to the onFieldPress Function.
